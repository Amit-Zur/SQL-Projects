# :hut: **World Life Expectancy Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis**

## Project Overview 
Welcome to **our** journey through the World Life Expectancy dataset, where we embark on a voyage of discovery, cleaning, and analysis. Our mission? To uncover the stories hidden within the numbers, revealing the heartbeat of global health.

## Dataset Overview
The World Life Expectancy dataset provides insights into key health and socio-economic indicators across various countries from the year 2007 to 2022. It encompasses a range of variables, including:
-  `lifeexpectancy`
-  `AdultMortality`
-  `BMI` (Body Mass Index)
-  `GDP` (Gross Domestic Product)
-  `Polio`
-  `Diphtheria`
