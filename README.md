# SQL-Projects

Welcome to the SQL Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects where SQL queries are used to analyze, manipulate, and visualize data

## Repository Structure

In each project folder, you will find the following components:

- Data Files: Raw data files in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) that are used as inputs for the SQL queries.
- SQL Queries: SQL scripts containing the queries used to extract, transform, and analyze the data.
- Cleaned Files: Processed and cleaned data files, often in the same format as the raw data.

Additionally, each project folder includes a README file that provides a detailed explanation of the project objectives, methodology, and key findings. These README files serve as comprehensive documentation for each project, making it easy for users to understand the analysis and replicate the results.
